Hi, my name is Giorgio and I'm a Software Engineer from Italy ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹

I really like creating products together with awesome teams and getting involved in the startup community.

I'm a passionate developer, fascinated by the Open-Source world and committed to transforming and shaping ideas into digital products.

I love getting my hands dirty with Go, Python, Javascript and Java. \
Following the trend of Cloud-Native development, I know how to use and orchestrate containers, scale them, deploy and mantain software in the cloud.

Currently @ [WarpDriveML](https://www.warpdriveml.com)
